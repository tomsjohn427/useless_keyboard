### Project Description
A fun and challenging Flutter app where the on-screen keyboard reshuffles keys after each press, making typing intentionally chaotic. It includes a 60-second typing test, haptic feedback, and completion/incompletion alerts with images.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most typing tests use predictable keyboards, which do not improve adaptability under unpredictable layouts.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A dynamic ‚Äúchaotic keyboard‚Äù that changes its key arrangement after every keystroke, testing a user‚Äôs adaptability and focus while typing.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Dart
- Flutter
- dart:async, dart:math, flutter/material.dart, and flutter/services.dart.
- Timer, Random, Material widgets, and HapticFeedback.

For Hardware:
- Not applicable (purely software project)

### Implementation
For Software:
A Flutter app with a custom-built on-screen keyboard that:
Randomizes key order after each non-special press
Tracks typing time with a countdown timer
Gives haptic feedback for certain keys
Displays completion or incompletion status using images in popups

# Installation
install flutter sdk on your device
flutter pub get
flutter run

# Run
flutter run
